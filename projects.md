Average arrival ages of US immigrants are increasing - from 26 years in 2000 to 31 years in 
2019. Past studies show that older immigrants may pay a penalty for spending less time in host 
countries than those arriving earlier. The net impact of immigration has been strongly linked 
to the age of arrival as well as migrants' levels of education. Using multilevel models, I estimate 
the early-arrival effect on the native-immigrant wage gap of male immigrants from 23 African 
countries in comparison with their US cohorts. Results show that African immigrants in the US 
experience a wage-gap and this may increase with arrival ages. However, adult arrivals from 
Anglophone countries counteract the claim that these arrivals are late and will most likely 
experience wage inequality - a result strongly linked to higher levels of education, English 
proficiency and transferability of African-earned degrees of Anglophone adults. This paper 
shows that the origin of education is salient in examining the economic assimilation of 
immigrants and the effect of age of arrival varies by these differences and contributes to the 
need for contextualizing age-of-arrival in describing what is late.
